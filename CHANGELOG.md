## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-16

### 🚀 New Features

- **SageAttention 2 Support**: Added full `sage_attention_2` attention mode for self-attention, bypassing block-sparse mask generation for fast dense attention.
- **Dual FP8 Quantization**: `fp8_e4m3fn` precision option halves DiT VRAM usage. Optional `torchao` float8 weight-only quantization further compresses model weights for 12GB GPUs.
- **torch.compile DiT Acceleration**: Experimental `--compile_dit` flag and GUI toggle enable `torch.compile` on the DiT model for reduced per-step latency.
- **xformers Memory-Efficient Attention Fallback**: When FlashAttn 2/3 and SageAttn are unavailable, `xformers.ops.memory_efficient_attention` serves as GPU-accelerated fallback (2-3x faster than SDPA).

### ⚡ Performance

- **Fused RMSNorm**: Leverages `flash_attn.ops.rms_norm` fused kernel for combined normalization + weight in a single CUDA kernel.
- **CausalConv3d Memory Optimization**: Restructured padding to keep spatial padding native to Conv3d, eliminating `F.pad` memory materialization during VAE encode/decode.
- **CPU Tensor Offloading (VAE Decode)**: Each decoded frame moved to CPU immediately in tiled decode loop, preventing full-batch GPU accumulation.
- **VAE Mask Caching**: Tiling blend masks cached via `@functools.lru_cache` to avoid redundant recomputation.
- **Tensor Layout Optimization**: Replaced `rearrange` with `view`/`reshape` across all attention backends (SageAttn, FlashAttn 2/3) to eliminate unnecessary memory copies.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **DiTBlock Unpack Crash**: Fixed `ValueError: too many values to unpack` when `is_stream=False` by conditionally returning KV cache tuples.
- **FP8 Pipe Transfer**: Prevented dtype mismatch crash by using `fp16` for `pipe.to()` when FP8 precision is selected.
- **Stream Decode Cache**: Added `self.clear_cache()` before `stream_decode` to prevent stale convolution caches.
- **VAE forward()/sample() Safety**: Replaced with `NotImplementedError` guards directing callers to proper encode/decode methods.
- **build_1d_mask Zero-Width Guard**: Added `border_width > 0` guard to prevent index errors on zero-width tiling boundaries.
- **Sparse Sage Import Safety**: Wrapped `sparse_sageattn` import in try/except for non-CUDA backends.
- **Block Attention Wiring**: Fixed `USE_BLOCK_ATTN` not being set to `True` when `attention_mode="block_sparse_attention"`.
- **torchao Exception Handling**: Added broad `Exception` catch for `quantize_()` failures beyond `ImportError`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-03

### 🚀 New Features

- **Custom Model Paths Configuration**: Added `model_paths.yaml` configuration file to specify custom directories for FlashVSR models.
  - Allows storing models on different drives (e.g., D:, E:) without code modification
  - Supports Windows (forward slashes and backslashes), Linux, and Mac path formats
  - Automatic directory creation if path doesn't exist
  - Path expansion support (`~` for home directory, environment variables)

- **Auto-Download to Custom Paths**: Model auto-download now respects the custom path configured in `model_paths.yaml`.
  - When models don't exist, they automatically download to the configured directory
  - All model files (DiT, LQ_proj, TCDecoder, VAE) download to custom path
  - Falls back to default ComfyUI models directory if config is empty

### ⚡ Performance

- **Configuration Caching**: Thread-safe module-level caching prevents repeated file I/O operations
- **Optimized Path Resolution**: Configuration loaded once at startup and cached for all subsequent operations

### 🛠 Technical Implementation

- Added `load_model_paths_config()`: Thread-safe YAML configuration loader with caching
- Added `get_flashvsr_model_base_dir()`: Helper function to resolve model base directory
- Updated `model_download()` to use custom path from configuration
- Updated `init_pipeline()` to construct paths using configuration
- Thread safety implemented with `threading.Lock()` for concurrent node loading
- Security: Uses `yaml.safe_load()` to prevent code injection

### 📖 Documentation

- Added comprehensive `model_paths.yaml` with:
  - Detailed instructions for Windows/Linux/Mac users
  - Multiple practical examples for different scenarios
  - Auto-download workflow explanation
  - Turkish and English documentation
- Updated README.md with:
  - "Step 3: Custom Model Paths" installation section
  - Auto-download support callout with examples
  - CLI usage examples with `--models_dir` parameter
- Added inline code comments explaining the configuration flow

### 🔧 Dependencies

- Added `pyyaml` to requirements.txt for YAML configuration parsing

## [1.2.9] - 2026-01-25

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Users with high VRAM can now set keep_models_on_cpu=False to keep models in VRAM throughout processing, eliminating offload overhead between tiles (~30-40% speedup for tiled operations on 24GB+ GPUs).

## [1.2.8] - 2026-01-20

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- FlashVSR nodes return half-precision tensors on CUDA, breaking downstream nodes that expect float32 on CPU. This causes type mismatch errors in FILM interpolator and other processing nodes.
- The tiled processing path creates final_output_canvas with dtype=torch.float16, causing accumulated results to remain in half precision despite tensor2video() converting to float32. Output tensors vary between fp16/bf16/CUDA depending on processing path.

## [1.2.7] - 2025-12-23

### ✨ New Features

- **5 New VAE Models**: Added support for `Wan2.2`, `LightVAE_W2.1`, `TAE_W2.2`, `LightTAE_HY1.5` (plus original `Wan2.1`).
- **Smart Resource Calculator**: Added "Pre-flight" check to analyze VRAM/RAM usage and recommend optimal settings before processing.
- **Auto-Download**: Added automatic downloading for missing VAE models from HuggingFace (`lightx2v/Autoencoders` repository).
- **Unified UI**: Replaced complex `vae_type` and `alt_vae` inputs with a single `vae_model` dropdown.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Black Borders**: Implemented correct "Padding → Process → Crop" logic to handle VAE dimension requirements without corrupting the output.
- **Fixed Video Glitches**: Corrected Tensor Permutation logic (`B,C,F,H,W` vs `B,H,W,C`) to prevent visual artifacts.
- **Fixed Model Loading**: Solved the issue where selecting "Wan2.2" incorrectly loaded "Wan2.1_VAE.pth".
- **Fixed OOM False Positive**: OOM recovery no longer triggers prematurely (adjusted threshold to 95%).

### ⚡ Optimization

- **Unified Pipeline**: Merged `tiny`, `full`, and `tiny-long` logic into a single optimized architecture.
- **OOM Protection**: Improved memory management with 95% VRAM threshold using `torch.cuda.mem_get_info()`.
- **Lossless Resize**: Uses `NEAREST` interpolation for integer scaling (0.5, 0.25) to avoid blur.
- **Aggressive Garbage Collection**: Added `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` before/after heavy VAE operations.

### 🛠 Refactoring

- **Explicit VAE Instantiation**: No more state_dict inspection/guessing - strict class mapping based on user selection.
- **VAE_MODEL_MAP**: Centralized configuration for all 5 VAE options (class, file, URL, dimensions).
- **Summary Logging**: End-of-processing report with total time, peak VRAM, and resolutions.
- **Debug Logging**: Shows `selected_model` vs `loaded_model_path` for verification.

### 📖 Documentation
